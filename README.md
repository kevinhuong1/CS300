# CS300
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
One of the issues I was having was figuring out how to exactly get the program to run via the requirements. For some of the projects I was able to get the code to run, but it wasnt populating data how I actually wanted it. 


How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To approach the problem, I had to go step by step and figure out what I was missing. I found that going section by section was easier because I was looking at one specific thing instead of the entire code. This helped me stay a bit more organized. Data structures are very important because it is the way to organize information. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
To overcome roadblocks, I had to do a bunch of outside learning. I had to use external resources to help me understand how the data structure works.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The work on this project helped me greatly because it made me think outside the box. Working with data structres is something that I will always rememember and I was glad that I had a chance to experience this course.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project helped me learn about data organization. It made me lay everything out in a readable and easy way to read. This project really helped me learn to be a better developer.
